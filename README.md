Python game made for CodeQuest 2025 by Arav Lahiri

For the game, you will require a compiler like Visual Studio Code that runs on your computer.

Go to python.org, install python, and tick "install python.exe to path"

Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and type <code>pip install pygame</code>. A computer restart may be required.

Make sure to open ALL of the images onto Visual Studio Code

Follow the video I have made for instructions as to how to play.
